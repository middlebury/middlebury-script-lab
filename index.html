<p>Idyllic Middlebury, Vermont, home to Middlebury College and the historic Bread Loaf campus</p>

    <div class="section-content">
      <h2 id="bring-your-story-to-vermont">Bring your story to Vermont</h2>

<p>Six emerging screenwriters — the fellows — will be invited to spend one week at Middlebury, in the Champlain Valley of Vermont.</p>

<p>The idyllic New England town of Middlebury will welcome screenwriters developing their first or second script. You will live and work in individual, comfortable rooms and find your inspiration in the crisp Vermont outdoors (town shuttles can take you up the mountain for a ski break!).</p>

<!-- Six emerging screenwriters &mdash; the fellows &mdash; will be invited to spend one week at Middlebury’s Bread Loaf campus in the Green Mountains of Vermont. -->

<!-- Acclaimed literary works have been conceived and developed at the Bread Loaf campus, home of the legendary [Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference](http://www.middlebury.edu/bread-loaf-conferences). The iconic yellow buildings will now welcome screenwriters developing their first or second script. You will find your inspiration sitting by the fireplace in the historic Bread Loaf Inn or skiing and snowshoeing in the crisp Vermont outdoors. -->

<!-- This residential experience is an extraordinary opportunity to focus intensely on your writing in a beautiful and tranquil location, receive feedback on your writing, and start thinking strategically about your screenplay’s journey to production. Lodging, meals, and tuition costs are on us. All you have to do is write. -->

<p>Writers, producers, script consultants, and agents — the advisors — will be offering their mentorship in workshops, master classes, and one-on-one conferences. Ample individual time is built into the week’s schedule, allowing fellows to make real progress on their screenplays.</p>

<p>The fellows will be shadowed by a handful of Middlebury students who are aspiring screenwriters and filmmakers themselves. They will be the fellows’ hosts and local guides, help with research if needed, and be a sounding board for new ideas — or simply provide an informed audience for pitches and readings.</p>

<p>We are particularly looking for talented emerging writers who have encountered extraordinary obstacles in their pursuit of a screenwriting career.</p>

<h2 id="send-us-your-work">Send us your work</h2>

<p>We are looking for compelling, exciting screenplays that have a completed first draft (75–120 pages). The screenplay should be the writer’s first or second feature script (no more than one other feature screenplay produced or sold) and fit the scale of an independent production. Writers who find brainstorming and discussion helpful will get the most out of the Script Lab.</p>

<p>The screenplay should be written in English, in any genre, and must be the original work of the author (no adaptations). At this time, we are only accepting individual writers — no teams — and we encourage submissions from writer-directors. Candidates must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents who are over 18 years of age on January 1, 2019.</p>

<p>The application process is handled via Film Freeway, and we initially ask that you send us the first 10 pages of your script accompanied by additional materials (as described in the Film Freeway application). If you are selected as a finalist for the second round of evaluation, we will ask for the full script to be submitted no later than October 20, 2018.</p>

      <h3 id="am-i-required-to-provide-proof-of-citizenshipresidency">Am I required to provide proof of citizenship/residency?</h3>

<p>No, we will take you at your word that you satisfy the requirement. We cannot make visa arrangements or offer support if you are not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.</p>

<h3 id="should-my-industry-contacts-call-you-to-provide-references">Should my industry contacts call you to provide references?</h3>

<p>No. We are only considering your writing and your personal statements. No references are necessary, nor would they make a difference.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-do-i-have-to-pay">How much do I have to pay?</h3>
<p>Fellows’ only costs will be travel costs to Burlington, Vermont (or to Middlebury if you are driving).</p>

<h3 id="what-if-i-dont-have-access-to-final-draft">What if I don’t have access to Final Draft?</h3>

<p>You can use other software that provides similar formatting, compatible with the industry standard (such as Celtx or Scrivener).</p>

<h3 id="can-teams-submit">Can teams submit?</h3>

<p>No, only individual writers or writer-directors can submit.</p>

<h3 id="are-adaptations-eligible">Are adaptations eligible?</h3>

<p>Not at this time — only original works are eligible.</p>

<h3 id="is-there-an-age-limit">Is there an age limit?</h3>

<p>Applicants must be 18 years or older.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-bring-my-partnerchildren">Can I bring my partner/children?</h3>

<p>You may be able to bring your partner if we can accommodate you in a double room. However, there is a fee for covering the partner’s room and board. Please <a href="https://forms.middlebury.edu/offices/news/middlebury-script-lab">contact us</a> if you are interested in this option. We are sorry that we cannot accommodate the presence of fellows’ children at this time.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-i-direct-additional-questions">Where can I direct additional questions?</h3>

<p>Please <a href="https://forms.middlebury.edu/offices/news/middlebury-script-lab">contact us</a> through our form or email us at <a href="mailto:screenwriters@middlebury.edu">screenwriters@middlebury.edu</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-i-cant-upload-my-pdf-on-film-freeway">What if I can’t upload my PDF on Film Freeway?</h3>

<p>Email us and we’ll arrange an alternative solution.</p>

<h3 id="who-are-the-workshop-advisors">Who are the workshop advisors?</h3>

<p>Established industry professionals — writers, directors, producers — as well as agents or script consultants who will offer advice and feedback tailored to your project. We strive to invite advisors who can contribute specifically to the selected projects.</p>

<h3 id="what-kind-of-activities-will-happen-at-the-workshop">What kind of activities will happen at the workshop?</h3>

<p>Activities will fall into three broad categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Group workshops (for fellows)</li>
  <li>Master classes, Q&amp;A sessions, and talks (open to a larger audience)</li>
  <li>One-on-one advising specific to each project</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course there will be plenty of time to write.</p>

<h3 id="how-will-i-be-notified-of-acceptance-and-other-important-information">How will I be notified of acceptance and other important information?</h3>

<p>Via email, so please make sure you give a current, working email address in the application.</p>

<h3 id="i-dont-have-professional-film-experience-can-i-apply">I don’t have professional film experience. Can I apply? </h3>

<p>Yes. We are very interested in writers with great potential who for some reason or another have never had a chance to be discovered. We are also interested in writers who practiced in another medium and are now looking to make a transition to screenwriting.</p>

<h3 id="i-dont-know-where-to-upload-my-script-pages-additional-materials-or-full-script-on-film-freeway">I don’t know where to upload my script pages, additional materials, or full script on Film Freeway.</h3>

<p>The application asks you to enter three additional documents (cover letter, artistic statement, personal statement) as answers to questions in designated rubrics. The first 10 pages of your script should be uploaded in the “script” section of your project. The treatment should be uploaded through the “add files” options of your Film Freeway project. If you already have a completed script and you upload it in the “script” section from the beginning, we will read only the first 10 pages initially; if you make it to the final round we’ll read the whole script.</p>

<h3 id="my-script-is-not-ready-or-wasnt-selected-for-a-fellowship-this-year-can-i-still-audit-the-script-lab">My script is not ready or wasn’t selected for a fellowship this year. Can I still audit the Script Lab?</h3>

<p>We are restricted by our budget and logistics to a maximum of six Script Lab fellows. A great number of applicants asked about the possibility of auditing the lab and offered to cover their own expenses. Therefore, a very limited number of invitations to audit the Script Lab will be extended to second-round finalists who have not been offered a fellowship and are interested in joining the lab and covering their own expenses. The auditors will benefit from all the components of the Script Lab, except for one-on-one mentoring. If you are interested in this option, you will be asked to check a box during the Film Freeway application process. If you are selected for the second round but your script is not ready by October 20 or we are not able to offer you a fellowship, you will be considered for an auditing position only if you have expressed your interest in this option.</p>

<p>If your project is selected for the second and final round of evaluation, you are a finalist. You will be notified of this status before October 15 and will be asked to submit the full script to us by October 20. Six of the finalists will be invited to become fellows and participate in the Script Lab.</p>
