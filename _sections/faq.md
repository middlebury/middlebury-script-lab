### AM I required to provide proof of citizenship/residency?

No, we will take you at your word  that you satisfy the requirement. We cannot make visa arrangements or offer support if you are not a US citizen or permanent resident.


### Should my industry contacts call you to provide references?

No. We are only considering your writing and your personal statements. No references are necessary nor would they make a difference.


### How much do I have to pay?

Your only costs will be the application fee and a portion of the travel costs.


### What does "partial travel costs" mean?

You will make your own travel arrangements and we will offer a fixed partial reimbursement of your travel costs. (should provide more information about the fixed partial reimbursement)

### What if I don't have access to Final Draft?

You can use another software that provides similar formatting, compatible with the industry standard. (should provide other software that would be acceptable)

### Can teams submit?

No, only individual writers or writer-directors.

### Are adaptations eligible?

Not at this time – only original works are eligible.

### Is there an age limit?

Applicants must be 18 years or older.

### Can I bring my partner/children?

You may be able to bring your partner if we can accommodate you in a double room. However, there is a fee for covering the partner’s room and board. You may contact us via email if you are interested in this option. (this doesn't answer the question regarding children)

### Where can I direct additional questions?

### What if I can't upload my pdf on Film Freeway?

(the next two FAQ's should go away or the information should live elsewhere)

### Why should I apply to this?

Here are three good reasons:

- you need a week away from everything to focus solely on your script
- you feel that you’d benefit from feedback, brainstorming and a fresh outside perspective on your work
- you have the talent and the drive but don’t have the financial means, connections or lucky circumstances to access industry professionals for advice and mentoring.

### Why is Middlebury doing this?

We want to use our expertise, network and resources to create a community of talented, bold, innovative screenwriters. We want to create a hub for tomorrow’s generation of storytellers where our students can witness the creative process and find inspirational role models.

### Who are the workshop advisors?

Established industry professionals – writers, directors, producers – as well as agents and script consultants who will offer advice and feedback tailored to your project. We strive to invite advisors who can contribute specifically to the selected projects.

### What kind of activities will happen at the workshop?

Activities will fall into three broad categories:

- group workshops (for Fellows)
- masterclasses, Q&A sessions and talks (open to a larger audience)
- one on one advising specific to each project

And of course plenty of time to write.

### How will I be notified of acceptance and other important information?

Via email, so please make sure you give a current, working email address in the application

(the next FAQ can go away)

### What's with the first/second round thing?

The initial Film Freeway application will request an excerpt of your screenplay. Based on this application we will select approximately 20 to 25 projects for which we will ask the full script. The final decision will be made based on the evaluation of the full script. There is no additional fee for the second round of evaluation.

### I don't have professional film experience. Can I apply? 

Yes. We are very interested in writers with great potential who for some reason or another have never had a chance to be discovered. We are also interested in writers who practiced in another medium and are now looking to make a transition to screenwriting.
