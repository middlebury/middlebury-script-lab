### Am I required to provide proof of citizenship/residency?

No, we will take you at your word  that you satisfy the requirement. We cannot make visa arrangements or offer support if you are not a US citizen or permanent resident.


### Should my industry contacts call you to provide references?

No. We are only considering your writing and your personal statements. No references are necessary nor would they make a difference.


### How much do I have to pay?

Your only costs will be a portion of the travel costs.


### What does "partial travel costs" mean?

You will make your own travel arrangements and we will offer a  partial reimbursement of your travel costs (the lesser between 300 USD and flight cost for flights, standard mileage for driving).

### What if I don't have access to Final Draft?

You can use another software that provides similar formatting, compatible with the industry standard (such as Celtx or Scrivener).

### Can teams submit?

No, only individual writers or writer-directors.

### Are adaptations eligible?

Not at this time – only original works are eligible.

### Is there an age limit?

Applicants must be 18 years or older.

### Can I bring my partner/children?

You may be able to bring your partner if we can accommodate you in a double room. However, there is a fee for covering the partner’s room and board. Please [contact us](https://forms.middlebury.edu/offices/news/middlebury-script-lab) if you are interested in this option. We are sorry that we cannot accommodate the presence of Fellows’ children at this time.

### Who are the workshop advisors?

Established industry professionals – writers, directors, producers – as well as agents or script consultants who will offer advice and feedback tailored to your project. We strive to invite advisors who can contribute specifically to the selected projects.

### What kind of activities will happen at the workshop?

Activities will fall into three broad categories:

- group workshops (for Fellows)
- masterclasses, Q&A sessions and talks (open to a larger audience)
- one on one advising specific to each project

And of course plenty of time to write.

### How will I be notified of acceptance and other important information?

Via email, so please make sure you give a current, working email address in the application

### I don't have professional film experience. Can I apply? 

Yes. We are very interested in writers with great potential who for some reason or another have never had a chance to be discovered. We are also interested in writers who practiced in another medium and are now looking to make a transition to screenwriting.
