## Bring your story to Vermont

Six emerging screenwriters&mdash;the fellows&mdash;will be invited to spend one week at Middlebury, in the Champlain Valley of Vermont.

The idyllic New England town of Middlebury will welcome screenwriters developing their first or second script. You will live and work in individual, comfortable rooms and find your inspiration in the crisp Vermont outdoors (town shuttles can take you up the mountain for a ski break!).

<!-- Six emerging screenwriters &mdash; the fellows &mdash; will be invited to spend one week at Middlebury’s Bread Loaf campus in the Green Mountains of Vermont. -->

<!-- Acclaimed literary works have been conceived and developed at the Bread Loaf campus, home of the legendary [Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference](http://www.middlebury.edu/bread-loaf-conferences). The iconic yellow buildings will now welcome screenwriters developing their first or second script. You will find your inspiration sitting by the fireplace in the historic Bread Loaf Inn or skiing and snowshoeing in the crisp Vermont outdoors. -->

<!-- This residential experience is an extraordinary opportunity to focus intensely on your writing in a beautiful and tranquil location, receive feedback on your writing, and start thinking strategically about your screenplay’s journey to production. Lodging, meals, and tuition costs are on us. All you have to do is write. -->

Writers, producers, script consultants, and agents &mdash; the advisors &mdash; will be offering their mentorship in workshops, master classes, and one-on-one conferences. Ample individual time is built into the week’s schedule, allowing fellows to make real progress on their screenplays. 

The fellows will be shadowed by a handful of Middlebury students who are aspiring screenwriters and filmmakers themselves. They will be the fellows’ hosts and local guides, help with research if needed, and be a sounding board for new ideas &mdash; or simply provide an informed audience for pitches and readings. 

We are particularly looking for talented emerging writers who have encountered extraordinary obstacles in their pursuit of a screenwriting career

## Send us your work

We are looking for compelling, exciting screenplays that have a completed first draft (75&ndash;120 pages). The screenplay should be the writer’s first or second feature script (no more than one other feature screenplay produced or sold) and fit the scale of an independent production. Writers who find brainstorming and discussion helpful will get the most out of the Script Lab.

The screenplay should be written in English, in any genre, and must be the original work of the author (no adaptations). At this time, we are only accepting individual writers &mdash; no teams &mdash; and we encourage submissions from writer-directors. Candidates must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents who are over 18 years of age on January 1, 2019. 

The application process is handled via Film Freeway and we initially ask that you send us the first ten pages of your script accompanied by additional materials (as described in the Film Freeway application). If you are selected as a finalist for the second round of evaluation, we will ask for the full script to be submitted no later than October 20 2019.
