## Bring your story to Vermont

Six emerging screenwriters&mdash;the Fellows&mdash;will be invited to spend one week at Middlebury, in the Champlain Valley of Vermont. The Script Lab covers all the expenses except for the travel costs.

The idyllic New England town of Middlebury will welcome screenwriters developing their first or second feature script or their first television series. You will live and work in individual, comfortable rooms and find your inspiration in the crisp Vermont outdoors (town shuttles can take you up the mountain for a ski break!).

Writers, producers, script consultants, and agents&mdash;the advisors&mdash;will be offering their mentorship in workshops, master classes, and one-on-one conferences. Ample individual time is built into the week’s schedule, allowing fellows to make real progress on their screenplays.

We are particularly looking for talented emerging writers who have encountered extraordinary obstacles in their pursuit of a screenwriting career.

## Send us your work 

We are looking for compelling, exciting screenplays that have a completed first draft (75–120 pages). The screenplay should be the writer’s first or second feature script (no more than one other feature screenplay produced or sold) and fit the scale of an independent production. For TV content, we request a full pilot script for 60 minute shows or the first two episodes for 30 minute shows, accompanied by a show bible. We accept all genres but we prefer serialized over episodic content. Writers who find brainstorming and discussion helpful will get the most out of the Script Lab.

The screenplay should be written in English, in any genre, and must be the original work of the author (no adaptations). Candidates must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents who are over 18 years of age on January 1, 2020.

The application process is handled via FilmFreeway and we initially ask that you send us the first ten pages of your script accompanied by additional materials (as described in the FilmFreeway application). If you are selected as a finalist for the second round of evaluation, we will ask for the full script(s) to be submitted no later than November 1st, 2019.

If you are selected as a Fellow, you must arrive in Middlebury on January 16, 2020, after 3 pm, and attend all the days of the Script Lab. Checkout is on January 23rd, 2020.
